There are lots of situations while browsing, web pages are needed to be classified in a structured and organized manner from the information embodied in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). URL classification is an effective technique to understand the frequently visited categories or URL’s of a user and also to detect inappropriate sites (such as pornographic sites).  The undisciplined nature of web-content makes it challenging to classify. To eradicate this problem we applied an improved machine learning approach which will provide a better result with less complexity. So we have proposed an improved method which is multiple n-gram language word based model for effective feature extraction and removing data imbalance problem using over sampling under the Random Search Pipeline which provides effective feature extraction and multinomial distribution for Naïve Bayes classifier.
